Note on this project: V.O.I.C.E. is a prototype I built to show how technology can become truly accessible for people who find traditional keyboards and mice difficult to use. To make sure the experience feels natural and dependable, I integrated Gemini 3 with a few smart system shortcuts—like using "Win+R" to open apps. These act as reliable bridges, allowing the assistant to respond quickly and correctly so we can focus on the real goal: making digital freedom a reality for everyone.
